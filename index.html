    <pre>My story: It all started in Class 10,
         a year that marked a significant turning
         point for me. Up until then, computers
         were just tools I used to play games or 
         occasionally finish school projects. 
         I never really thought much beyond that. 
         But that year, something clicked—and my whole 
         perspective on computers changed.

        It began with the introduction of a new subject: 
        Computer Applications. Until then, I had been 
        content with the basic computer skills I picked 
        up in earlier grades—using Word to type assignments 
        or Excel for simple calculations. But Computer 
        Applications was different. It was a subject that 
        didn’t just focus on using software; it was about 
        understanding how computers actually work and how 
        to harness their power in creative ways.

        I appreciate everything you do, and I’m grateful to have you around.
